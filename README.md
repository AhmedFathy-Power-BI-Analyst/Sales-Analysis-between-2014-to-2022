## Introduction

Analyzing sales data is crucial for understanding the performance of a company and identifying areas for improvement. This project utilizes Microsoft Power BI Analytics to delve into the sales data of the company and extract meaningful insights. By visualizing sales metrics such as revenue, units sold, and profitability, we aim to provide actionable insights to stakeholders and decision-makers.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two CSV files:

1. **2016.csv**: Contains sales data for the year 2016, including information such as date, product ID, units sold, revenue, and customer details.
